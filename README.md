# Starter mu-plugins

This is my starting point for the `mu-plugins` folder.

It includes modifications of core WordPress along with configuration changes to Advanced Custom Fields PRO, The Events Calendar, Editoria11y, WP-CFM, and the Archived Post Type plugins. WP-CFM is required to sync starter WP and Editoria11y settings.

Pairs nicely with [my hybrid starter theme](https://github.com/mrwweb/hybrid-starter-theme).
